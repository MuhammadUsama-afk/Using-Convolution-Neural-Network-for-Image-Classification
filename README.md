# Using-Convolution-Neural-Network-for-Image-Classification
An implementation of Transfer Learning to obtain excellent results

Convolution Neural Networks are extensively used for image classification applications. I am going to implement a CNN and try to model a classifier which will provide a descent accuracy and minimal loss while being trained on a limited data set. I will use techniques like Transfer Learning and I will justify the path I have followed to tackle the problem. Here our goal is to differentiate between images of Dolphins and Sea-horses. The dataset is downloaded from github and consists of less than 120 images.
